Changes in version 3.9.0.0 (06.04.2009) 
-----------------------------------
* Added EPPLoginCmd.mergeServicesAndExtensionServices(EPPGreeting) method and added a call from EPPSession.login to merge the default services and extension services included in the EPP Login with the services and extension services return in the EPP Greeting.  This will ensure protocol compliance of the EPP Login even when there are many more services configured on the client side. (James F. Gould)

(Leela Koneru)  

Changes in version 3.8.0.1 (27.10.2008) 
-----------------------------------
* Fixed EPPPurpose(boolean, boolean, boolean, boolean) constructor to set the property based on the parameters instead of setting the properties to false.  Also updated EPPCodecTst.testGreeting to add assertions for the fix. (James F. Gould)
* Added the initMaxActive EPPSessionPool property to set if at initialization whether maxActive sessions should be created.  The default behavior is "false" which will create sessions on demand.  (James F. Gould)
* Added the for borrowRetries EPPSessionPool property to set the number of retries that should be executed if on call to borrowObject() or borrowObject(String) there is a failure getting/creating a session.  The default value is 0 and setting the property to a positive value will result in one attempt plus the number of borrowRetries attempts. (James F. Gould)
* Added Name Suggestion language element. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.8.0.0 (16.01.2008) 
-----------------------------------
* In com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainTst, changed to load the EPPHostMapFactory prior to the EPPDomainMapFactory based on the dependency of the domain-1.0.xsd to the host-1.0.xsd. (James F. Gould) 
* Fixed issue that the XML Parser Pool needs to be initialized after the CODEC to properly pre-load all of the dependency XML schemas. (James F. Gould)
* Changed (!theResponse instanceof CLASS) calls in EPPDomain.java, EPPHost.java, and EPPContact.java to use the new EPPSession.processDocument(EPPCommand, Class) : EPPResponse calls to allow for the new EPPSession.MODE_ASYNC mode where null can be returned from EPPSession.processDocument(EPPCommand) and EPPSession.processDocument(EPPCommand, Class). (James F. Gould)
* Added testAsyncCommands() to NSDomainTst.java to test use of the MODE_ASYNC with EPPSession. (James F. Gould)
* Added doAsyncPoll() to EPPSessionTst.java to test poll messaging with the EPPSession mode set to MODE_ASYNC. (James F. Gould)
* Added processDocument(aCommand : EPPCommand, aExpectedResponse Class) method, and isModeSupported(int) : boolean method to EPPHttpSession.java to support the new EPPSession API but to specify to the client that EPPHttpSession does NOT support MODE_ASYNC mode. (James F. Gould)
* Added MODE_SYNC constant, MODE_ASYNC constant, setMode(int) : int method, getMode() : int method, isModeSupported(int) : boolean method, processDocument(aCommand : EPPCommand, aExpectedResponse Class) method, readResponse() : EPPResponse to support asynchronous mode for implementing pipelining. (James F. Gould)  
* Added missing com.verisign.epp.serverstub.ContactPollHandler from the EPP.PollHandlers property of epp-http.config. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.7.0.3 (26.09.2007) 
-----------------------------------
* Added "getXmlSchemas() : Set" method to EPPFactory, EPPMapFactory, EPPExtFactory, and the derived classes of EPPMapFactory and EPPExtFactory to specify the XML schemas that need to be pre-loaded.  The schemaLocation attribute is optional with EPP RFC 4930, so dynamically loading the XML schemas will not consistently work.  All XML schemas will be pre-loaded by EPPSchemaCachingParser based on the configured EPP.MapFactories and EPP.CmdRspExtensions.  The order of the factories is signifant, where EPPHostMapFactory should precede EPPDomainMapFactory since the domain-1.0.xsd depends on the host-1.0.xsd. (James F. Gould)  
* Updated the gen, domain, host, contact, and tcp specifications and XML schemas to match the May 2007 RFC's. (James F. Gould)  
* Updated the copyright dates in license.txt to include 2004-2007.

-----------------------------------
* Updated com.verisign.epp.domain.interfaces.EPPDomainTst, com.verisign.epp.domain.interfaces.EPPHostTst, com.verisign.epp.domain.interfaces.EPPContactTst to get the EPPResponse from the EPPCommandException within handleException(Exception) instead of relying on the EPPResponse.getResponse() method. (James F. Gould)
* Updated com.verisign.epp.domain.interfaces.EPPDomain, com.verisign.epp.domain.interfaces.EPPHost, com.verisign.epp.domain.interfaces.EPPContact to not use a response attribute, but to use a local variable.  Updated the getResponse() : EPPResponse method to call the session.getResponse() method to get the last response. (James F. Gould)
* Updated EPPSession.processDocument to using the myResponse attribute instead of a local variable and to set it to null at the start of the method to properly support the public getResponse() : EPP Response method, which returns that last response of the last command if one was returned. (James F. Gould)
* Updated the Programmers guide for DotJobs section. Modified the EPP.CmdRspExtensions configuration parameter to EPPJobsContactExtFactory. (Rupert Fernando)


Changes in version 3.7.0.1 (14.09.2007) 
-----------------------------------

The EPPXMLStream.MAX_PACKET_SIZE has been renamed to EPPXMLStream.DEFAULT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE and used if the EPP.MaxPacketSize property is not set. (James F. Gould)
* Added support for specifying a period of 0 to match the EPP specification as identified in SR 1288144. (James F. Gould)
* Fixed EPPDomainInfoCmd.HOSTS_NONE constant to have a value of "none" instead of "del". (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.6.2.0 (13.11.2006) 
-----------------------------------
* Updated EPPSession.endSession and EppHttpSession.endSession to ensure that the connection is closed even if the logout fails. (James F. Gould)

* Made EPPSession.endConnection public and added a call to EPPSession.endConnection within EPPSessionPoolableFactory.makeObject when an EPPCommandException is raised from EPPSession.initSession() which could cause a connection leak. (James F. Gould)
* Updated EPPSessionPool to check that the aSession parameter is not null at the start of the invalidateObject and returnObject methods to ensure that numActive pool count does not go negative. which is an issue with the Jakarta Commons Object Pool. (James F. Gould) 
* Added gen epp-client.config and epp-server.config for local session pool SSL configuration testing. (James F. Gould)
* Updated EPPSSLImpl.initialize() to reference EPPEnv.getSSLEnabledCipherSuites() and EPPEnv.getSSLEnabledProtocols. (James F. Gould)
* Added EPPEnv.getSSLEnabledCipherSuites() : String[] based on the optional EPP.SSLEnabledCipherSuites property. (James F. Gould)
* Added debug level logging of the supported protocols and cipher suites when a connection is made in com.verisign.epp.transport.client.EPPSSLClientSocket. (James F. Gould)

* Explicitely set the pool minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration property to 0 in EPPSessionPool.initSinglePool and EPPSystemSessionPool.init to ensure that Generic Object Pool idle timeout checking is disabled.  The EPPSessionPool handles EPP absoluate and idle timeouts. (James F. Gould)  
* Fix for SR #907237 where the epp.config Session Pool idleTimeout properties higher than timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis properties resulted in the EPP Hello not be sent since the Evictor Thread called the EPPSessionPoolableFactory.passivateObject(Object) method which touched the session.  The touch was moved up to EPPSessionPool.returnObject methods, removed from EPPSessionPoolableFactory, and a test was added to EPPSessionPoolTst for idle timeout.  (James F. Gould).
* Javadoc updates to the Name Suggestion Product (Mahendra Jain)

Changes in version 3.4.1.0 (13.03.2006) 
-----------------------------------
* Removed the validation of a null authString on a Transfer Request in com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomain and com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainTransferCmd to support transfer requests for COM, NET Domains created in RRP.  Also added a test case to com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomainTst for this.  (James F. Gould)
* Added the ability to run the CLS tests against OT&E by setting the EPP.Test.clientId property, the EPP.Test.password property, the EPP.Test.EPP.Test.cls.domainName to a domain in CLS, and the EPP.Test.stubServer property to false. (James F. Gould)
* Updated EPPNamestoreExtDomainTst, EPPNamestoreExtHostTst, and EPPRccContactTst to use the EPP.Test.clientId property and the EPP.Test.password property with the defaults of "ClientX" and "foo-BAR2", respectively as a first step in running the test against OT&E. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.4.0.1 (19.01.2006)

-----------------------------------
* Added whois to the NameStore bundle which included adding setWhoisInfo(boolean) to NSDomain, adding com.verisign.epp.codec.whois.EPPWhoisExtFactory to the default EPP.CmdRspExtensions property, adding test code in both NSDomainTst and NSDomainHandler. (James F. Gould)
* Fixed an issue with EPPDomainInfoCmd when the hosts attribute is not set, which is the default, that caused the com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainTst test to fail. (James F. Gould) 
* Fixed incorrect reference of EPPCLSBidInterfaceTst.suite() to EPPCLSItemInterfaceTst.suite() in EPPCLSItemInterfaceTst.java. (Colin Lloyd)

* Added handling of the new EPPAssemblerException constant objects types COMMANDNOTFOUND, RESPONSENOTFOUND, and EXTENSIONNOTFOUND.  (James F. Gould)
* Added handling of EPPComponentNotFoundException in EPPXMLAssembler by mapping the kind attribute to EPPAssemblerException constant object types. (James F. Gould)
* Added COMMANDNOTFOUND, RESPONSENOTFOUND, and EXTENSIONNOTFOUND constant objects to EPPAssemblerException to identify when a specific compoonent can not be found in EPPAssembler.toEvent. (James F. Gould)  
* Added EPPComponentNotFoundException to be thrown by EPPCodec.decode, EPPCommand.decode, and EPPResponse.decode when a mapping or extension component can not be found.  (James F. Gould)
* Fixed text included in error log and EPPConException when EPPSSLClientSocket can not establish a connection.  (James F. Gould)
* Added new Log4J category called com.verisign.epp.util.EPPXMLStream.packet for logging packets sent and received for routed to a seperate log file.  Added new appender in logconfig.xml to demonstrate creating a seperate log. This is based on SR 472609. (James F. Gould)
* Updated com.verisign.epp.codec.rcccontact.EPPContactUpdateCmd to not default the legal contact to the value of the general contact.  This is based on SR #464229.  (James F. Gould)
* Added negative test scenario change to NSDomainHandler to return PARAM_VALUE_POLICY_ERROR with a EPPNamestoreExtNSExtErrData extension when the subProductID is "BAD". (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.2.0.2 (05.09.2005)
-----------------------------------
* Added support for multiple session pools keyed by system name.  Added EPPSystemSessionPool, EPPSystemSesionPoolTest, and updated the associated classes EPPSessionPool, EPPHttpSessionPoolableFactory, EPPPoolGenericSession, EPPSessionPoolablefactory, and EPPSessionPoolTst.  Also updated epp.config and epp-http.config files to reference the system session pools.  (James F. Gould)  
* Added setProperty(String, String) to Environment to support overriding properties from within tests.  (James F. Gould)
* Replaced draft-hollenbeck-epp-rgp-04.txt with epp-rgp-rfc3915.txt to reference the RFC instead of the draft for RGP.  (James F. Gould)
* Added handing of com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainPendActionMsg to NSPollTst and NSPollHandler in support of JOBS.  Also added handling of EPPClsPollResponse in NSPollHandler.  (James F. Gould)  
* Added JOBS and NAME constants to NSSubProduct, and added checking for null in the setSubProductID methods of NSDomain and NSHost. (James F. Gould)  
* Removed unused EPPHTTPClientCon and EPPHTTPSClientCon since EPPHTTPSession utilizes Jakarta HTTP Client in place of these classes.  The references to these classes were removed from the configuration files and documentation.  (James F. Gould)
* Made EPP.ClientSocketName optionally in EPPEnv since the HTTP and HTTPS transports don't use this property. (James F. Gould)
* Changed isKnown deprecated method call in EPPRccHostTst to isAvailable method call.  (James F. Gould)
* Changed EPPHttpSession service comparison check to log a warning when there is a mismatch in the same way as EPPSession. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.2.0.1 (11.08.2005)
-----------------------------------

* Added CLS product (Colin W. Lloyd)
* Added encode/decode methods for BigDecimal to EPPUtil in the codec package in gen. (Colin W. Lloyd) 
* Fix bug with setting the roid in EPPAuthInfo where the roid was placed in the authInfo element instead of the pw element.  Updated associated EPPDomainTst's. (James F. Gould)
* Added EPPDomain.setAuthRoid(String) and EPPDomain.getAuthRoid for use with thick registries and the sendTransfer and sendInfo methods. (James F. Gould)
* Added EPPSession(String, int) method and dependent methods to allow for a client connection to made to a different host and port than what is defined in epp.config.  This is useful if the client needs to connect to multiple servers.  (James F. Gould) 
* In EPPSSLImpl, EPPHttpSession, and EPPHTTPSClientCon removed Sun JSSE 1.0.2 references and used default algorithm for both the KeyManagerFactory and the TrustManagerFactory, and deprecated use of EPPEnv.getSSLKeyManager.  This will allow the SDK to easily use different JSSE providers. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.1.0.3 (31.03.2005)
-----------------------------------
* Fixed misspelling of PP.SSLKeyManager and PP.SSLKeyStore to EPP.SSLKeyManager and EPP.SSLKeyStore, respectively in bundles/namestore/epp.config and bundles/namestore/epp-http.config  (James F. Gould)  
* Added description of successful execution of test-client-server target to section 4.2 of the Programmer's Guide. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.1.0.2 (23.03.2005)

* Updated small documentation error with <check> response in the EPP-NamestoreExt-Mapping.  (James F. Gould)
* Updated small sample error in <delete> response of the EPP-RCCDomain-Mapping.  (James F. Gould)

* Updated the Programmer's Guide to identify setPeriodLength as a required property of EPPRccDomain.sendCreate(). (James F. Gould)
* Change EPPRccDomainTst to pass a domain id number instead of the string to be more consistent with the documentation.  (James F. Gould)
* Added conversion of dates to UTC when encoding and decoding in EPPUtil to resolve an issue when passing the expiration date with a domain renew command. (James F. Gould)
* Updated all of the codec tests to not use the DocumentBuilderFactory and to call the EPPCodecTst.initEnvironment method in suite. (James F. Gould)

Changes in version 3.0.0.9 (17.02.2005), renamed to 3.1.0.1 to better reflect update.
-----------------------------------
* Added use of a 20k BufferedOutputStream in EPPSession and EPPServerThread to ensure that the EPP packets are sent in a single TCP packet (James F. Gould)
* Added static setProperties(Properties) method to Environment for setting the Environment without a EPP SDK specific configuration file (James F. Gould)
* Added catching of InterruptedIOException in EPPXMLStream.readPacket(InputStream) and logging a debug message instead of a generic IOException error message.
* Updated EPPXMLStreamTst to handled the throwing of InterruptedIOException from EPPXMLStream.readPacket(InputStream). (James F. Gould) 

Changes in version 3.0.0.8 (28.12.2004)
-----------------------------------
* Changed the loading of configuration properties as System properties to the use of a local Properties attribute of com.verisign.epp.util.Environment. (James F. Gould)
* Changed all property calls in com.verisign.epp.util.EPPEnv to use methods of com.verisign.epp.util.Environment and not depend on System properties. (James F. Gould)
* Removed use of javax.net.ssl.trustStore, javax.net.ssl.keyStore, and javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword properties.  The new properties EPP.SSLTrustStoreFileName and EPP.SSLTrustStorePassPhrase should be used for trust store configuration.  The previously existing EPP.SSLKeyFileName and EPP.SSLPassPhrase should be used in place of javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword. (James F. Gould)
* Added optional property EPP.SSLKeyPassPhrase for using a different pass-phrase for the private key than the keystore, as defined by the EPP.SSLPassPhrase property. (James F. Gould)
* Refactored com.verisign.epp.transport.client.EPPSSLImpl so that it includes an initialize method and that it's defined as a set of static properties and methods instead of an abstract class.  Added the static accessor methods getSSLContext() : SSLContext, isInitialized() : boolean, and getSSLSocketFactory() : SSLSocketFactory for initializing any SSL configuration including HTTPS.  (James F. Gould)
* Refactored com.verisign.epp.transport.client.EPPHTTPSClientCon to use the new com.verisign.epp.transport.client.EPPSSLImpl interface and to not use an inner class. It was determined that this class is not actually used for HTTPS, since HTTPSession uses Jakarts HTTPClient.  (James F. Gould)
* Updated com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPHttpSession to initialize SSL using com.verisign.epp.transport.client.EPPSSLImpl and use the EPPSSLImpl socket factory for the default SSL socket factory of HttpsURLConnection.  This removed the dependency to the setting of the javax.net.ssl System properties and had HTTPS use the same keystore and truststore as SSL.  (James F. Gould)
* Removed use of deprecated method isKnown in com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPNamestoreExtHostTst and com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPRccHostTst (James F. Gould)  
* Updated default properties in all configuration files (epp.config, epp-http.config) to use the new set of properties in the 3.0.0.8 release. (James F. Gould)  
* Updated com.verisign.epp.transport.server.EPPSSLServer to use the updated com.verisign.epp.transport.client.EPPSSLImpl interface and to not extend EPPSSLImpl.  Also added accessors for the listening property for future use. (James F. Gould)
* Updated com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPApplication, com.verisign.epp.serverstub.Server, and com.verisign.epp.serverstub.InitServlet to search for the log configuration in the order: the file system, the system ClassLoader, and then the current class ClassLoader. (James F. Gould)
* Removed definition of the jvmarg javax.net.ssl.trustStore from all of the common-targets.xml files since the EPP.SSLTrustStoreFileName and EPP.SSLTrustStorePassPhrase should be used.  (James F. Gould)



Changes in version 3.0.0.7 (7.12.2004)
-----------------------------------

* Added getHosts() : String and setHosts(String) to com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomain (James F. Gould)
* Added HOSTS_ALL, HOST_DELEGATED, and HOSTS_SUBORDINATE constants to com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomain (James F. Gould)
* Added use of authString attribute (setAuthString and getAuthString) in sendInfo() of com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomain (James F. Gould)
* Updated com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomainTst to exercise setHosts and setAuthString with sendInfo() (James F. Gould)
* Added EPPDomainInfoCmd(String, String, EPPAuthInfo) constructor to com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainInfoCmd (James F. Gould)
* Added getAuthInfo() : EPPAuthInfo and setAuthInfo(EPPAuthInfo) to com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainInfoCmd (James F. Gould)
* Updated com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainTst to exercise authInfo methods of com.verisign.epp.codec.domain.EPPDomainInfoCmd (James F. Gould)
* Updated Namestore SDK Programmer's Guide with updated com.verisign.epp.interfaces.EPPDomain interface and sample code (James F. Gould)
